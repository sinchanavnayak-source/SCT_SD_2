# Task2 - Number Guessing Game (Java)

This is a simple console-based **Number Guessing Game** written in Java.

## How It Works
- The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- The user keeps guessing until they find the correct number.
- After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- When you guess correctly, it displays the number of attempts you took.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Java JDK** installed.
2. Save the file as `Task2.java`.
3. Open a terminal and compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac Task2.java
